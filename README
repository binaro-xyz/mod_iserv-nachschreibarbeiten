# Dependencies
This IServ module depends on the 'exam_plan' module supplied by IServ. If 'exam_plan' is not installed, iservchk will report an error and this module will not function properly.

# Installation
To install this module, just copy all files from this directory into the root directory of your IServ (all relevant files are in /usr/share/iserv). Then run iservchk to apply all relevant settings.

# Privileges
This module adds two new privileges that need to be assigned to the appropriate groups in order for the module to be usable: 'mod_nachschreibarbeiten_access' (which allows access to
the module, generally assigned to all teachers) and 'mod_nachschreibarbeiten_admin' (which allows the user to administer the module, generally assigned to a dedicated group).
